# Ceph
This is my opinion, but I rather have ceph external for any large k8s deployments, or multiple k8s cluster. Easier to manage and not dependant on k8s itself. But downside is that gets more complex as now need to manage another system and then networking needs to be more involved
If it was smallish sure since less things to go wrong
